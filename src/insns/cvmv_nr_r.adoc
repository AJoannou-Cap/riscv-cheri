==== CVMV<NR>R.V

Synopsis::
Whole vector register move capabilities

Mnemonics::
`cvmv<nr>r.v vd, vs2`

Encoding::
include::wavedrom/cvmv_nr_r.adoc[]

Description::
Whole vector register move capabilities
+
Other than the support for CHERI capabilities, these instructions operate in the same way as the corresponding
vector whole vector register move, `vmv<nr>r.v`. The tag bits associated with the destination are
updated by copying the corresponding tag bit associated with the source.
+
Traps on these instructions will always be reported with a value of `vstart` that is a multiple of `CLEN` / `EEW`,
and will raise an illegal instruction exception if `vstart` does not meet this condition.

Prerequisites::
{cheri_base_ext_name}, V, {cheri_vectorcap_ext_name}

Operation::
[source,SAIL,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
