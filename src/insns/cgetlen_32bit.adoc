==== CGETLEN

include::new_encoding_note.adoc[]

Synopsis::
Capability get length

Mnemonic::
`cgetlen rd, cs1`

Encoding::
include::wavedrom/cgetlen.adoc[]

Description::
Calculate the length of `cs1` 's bounds and write the result in `rd`. The length
is defined as the difference between the decoded bounds' top and base addresses
i.e. `top - base`. It is not required that the input capability `cs1`  has its
tag set to 1. <<CGETLEN>> outputs 0 if `cs1` 's bounds are malformed (see
xref:section_cap_malformed[xrefstyle=short]), and 2^XLENMAX^-1 if the length of
`cs1` is 2^XLENMAX^.

Prerequisites::
{cheri_base_ext_name}

Operation:: TODO #need to check that it returns 0 if malformed#
